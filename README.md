# Health-spot
A small Next.js web app that predicts optimal clinic locations for multiple regions using a weighted K-Means algorithm implemented with scikit-learn and NumPy. Allows users to visualize recommended clinic placements on a simple map or chart, simulating improved coverage in high-risk areas. This prototype is designed for demonstration purposes only.
